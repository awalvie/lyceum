# Devlog

Devlog serves as an active journal of [awalvie](awalvie.html)'s
development exploits. It aligns with the [**Work with the garage door

philosophy.

Devlog isn't necessarily technical, in fact usually it isn't. It helps
identify and keep track of progress made while developing and working
with software. It also serves as a historical record that can looked
back on.
