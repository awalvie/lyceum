<p>To the dumb question “Why me?” the cosmos barely bothers to return the reply: why not</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mortality by Christopher Hitchens is an extremely candid look at life, religion, faith and death while battling esophageal cancer during the final 19 months of his life, with one of the most heartbreaking final chapters I’ve read.</p>
<p>I first picked up <strong>God is not Great</strong>, but decided that it was a little too difficult for me. The number of references he made in the Introduction already made me feel severely uneducated. As Richard Dawkins remarked in his interview with Hitchens</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You seem to have read absolutely everything. I can’t think of anybody since Aldous Huxley who’s so well read.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A graduate of Oxford, renowned the world over for his oration, views on religion and atheism, journalism and writings Hitchens stuck to his beliefs, and faced death the same way he had always faced life, right in the eyes. He did not take Pascal’s Wager and lived the last months of his life doing what he loved, reading, writing and talking.</p>
