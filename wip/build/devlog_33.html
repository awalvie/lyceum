    <main><p>Still sick. Most of my time yesterday and today has been spent looking at other people work. We've been using Visual Studio Code's Live Share feature and I have to say, it's pretty darn good and seamless. Working on it has been breeze. We can even share localhost servers between all of us to test our the changes made.</p>
<p>Our project is written in node and react, inspite of my best efforts, and since I know nothing about writing JS I've just been helping out with research, adding a line of code here and there, testing and debugging and providing friendly banter to keep us energised and awake while working on the idea. It is now coming along quite well and we should have a relatively stable project for showcasing, which I'm very happy about.</p>
