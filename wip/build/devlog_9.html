    <main><p>I've had relatives over since yesterday (yeah, I protested given the present situation, but I'm still a <strong>kid</strong>), and by now, they are driving me nuts. I don't do well (even with relatives) with people for elongated periods of time, especially when it's pampered, whining, loud, annoying teens (yes, my mental age is 40, go figure). Also since apparantly I'm the circus clown I'm told to spend my time with them. Yesterday, I wasn't able to do anything. I needed to get work done, so I woke up at 3:15 AM today and got things done. I hate wasted days, and since I've been trying to get better, I did not want to give myself the opportunity to relapse.</p>
<p>I did start with writing the code for <code>Stage 1</code> of the shell workshop. It's been pretty fun. I noticed some issues with my NeoVim config and also debugged those. <code>AutoClose</code> does not work well in conjunction with <code>Coc</code>. I had to press <code>Esc</code> twice to get rid of it's autocomplete suggestions which had been bugging me for a while. I also found a neat little trick to show my indent lines while editing code. Finally I've been writing code according to the kernel style guide and it seemed wonky at first but after 4 hours of reading and writing code, I can definitely see why it's the standard.</p>
<p>Finally, Devine's probably going to be here in a couple of days and I'm so excited!</p>
