    <main><h1>Quotes</h1>
<p><em>I feel myself driven towards an end that I do not know. As soon as I
have reached it, as soon as I shall become unnecessary, an atom will
suffice to shatter me. Until then, all the forces of mankind can do
nothing to stop me.</em></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Napoleon</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><em>There is no such thing as talent. There is only a history of one's self
that is so easily forgotten. A history full of experiences - or a
history devoid of them. A history of exposure to some things over
others. So relax. You're not special. You're not uniquely ungifted.
You're just showing up to a jousting match armed with a bow and arrow,
and don't yet fully understand the difference. But you will, if you're
willing to get knocked down to the ground over and over again. You're
allowed to feel down on yourself, and you're allowed to cry over your
scrapes. Just don't forget: rather than talent, it is another t-word
that makes a master. Tenacity.</em></p>

</ul>
<p><em>But he did not understand the price. Mortals never do. They only see the
prize, their heart's desire, their dream... But the price of getting
what you want is getting what you once wanted.</em></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Morpheus, The Sandman</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><em>I went to the woods because I wished to live deliberately, to front only
the essential facts of life, and see if I could not learn what it had to
teach, and not, when I came to die, discover that I had not lived.</em></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Henry David Thoreau</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><em>Everything we hear is an opinion, not a fact. Everything we see is a
perspective, not the truth.</em></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Marcus Aurelius</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><em>Never risk what you have and need for what you don’t have and don’t
need.</em></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Warren Buffett</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><em>When you want to gladden your heart, think of the good qualities of
those around you; the energy of one, the modesty of another, the
generosity of a third. For there is nothing more heartening than the
images of the virtues shining forth in the characters of those around
us.</em></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Marcus Aurelius</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><em>The truth may be puzzling. It may take some work to grapple with. It may
be counterintuitive. It may contradict deeply held prejudices. It may
not be consonant with what we desperately want to be true. But our
preferences do not determine whats true.</em></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Carl Sagan</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><em>Life should not be a journey to the grave with the intention of arriving
safely in a pretty and well preserved body, but rather to skid in
broadside in a cloud of smoke, thoroughly used up, totally worn out, and
loudly proclaiming &quot;Wow! What a Ride!</em></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Hunter S. Thompson</strong></li>
</ul>
