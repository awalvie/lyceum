    <main><p>I don't like buying things unless I'm getting rid of something at the
same time, or unless it's essential. The less things I have the more I
can concentrate on using and being creative with them. Intent and the
drive to act, is more important than possessing the best tools. It's the
artist who makes art, not the brush. Here are some of the things I feel
would help me in future endeavors.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Trekking Gear</strong>: Shoes, Bag, Trekking Pole, Trekking Clothing etc.
As mentioned above I have been inspired to trek and experience nature
solely due to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/KadamsMedia">Kraig Adam's YouTube
Channel</a>. I've always lived
my life indoors and never have experienced the nature for what it
truly is. I plan on doing so in the future.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Chef's Knife</strong>
I've been learning cooking from my mother during the lockdown. In the
tree of skills needed to be self-reliant, cooking is an essential.
While I have learnt a lot, my mother has just got used to using dull
tools. I've been practicing with an old Chef's Knife, but its not
sharp and has a bad handle. Dull knives are more dangerous than sharp
knives.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Aeropress</strong>
I have been drinking instant coffee for the past 5-7 years. It doesn't
taste good, but it's cheap. I'd like to venture furthur and experiment
with brewing methods now that I can afford to invest time and money
into the hobby. The brewing apparatus is portable, durable, quick and
supposedly produces delicious coffee.</p>
