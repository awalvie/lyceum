<p>“I told him I believed in hell, and that certain people, like me, had to live in hell before they died, to make up for missing out on it after death, since they didn't believe in life after death, and what each person believed happened to him when he died.”</p>

<p>The Bell Jar by Sylvia Plath is the story of a fictional character Esther Greenwood and her descent and recovery from depression.</p>
<p>I tried hard to relate to Ester many times, tried to empathize with her experiences and observations, but I wasn't able to. Depression is a strange condition, one that is almost impossible to put into words. I don't really have any thoughts on the book. It just didn't make sense to me personally.</p>
