    <main><p>I write this two days after we've submitted our hackathon project, <a href="https://github.com/zerefwayne/mlh-township">MLH Township</a>. The original project idea was to make an RPGesq web game, where you could find people throughtout the fellowship by walking around on the map, and play mini-games and have discussion rooms where you could talk about different topics or ongoing MLH Events.</p>
<p>As it usually is the original idea proved to be far trickier than I had initally expected, and we barely managed to scrape together by the end of the hackathon a very simple version of the original idea.</p>
<p>I didn't contribute a whole lot of code to the projcet, both because I was pretty sick and because I didn't know either of NodeJS or React (which the project is written in). I did get to know however a lot about websockets and webRTC and how to use them in an actual project which was great.</p>
