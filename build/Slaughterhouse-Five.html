<p>The nicest veterans…the kindest and funniest ones, the ones who hated war the most, were the ones who’d really fought.</p>

<p>Kurt Vonnegut’s Slaughterhouse 5 also known by it’s underappreciated alternate name <em>The Children’s Crusade</em> is an anti-war book. It was written in 1969 during the Vietnam War but it talks about the World War II, the air-raid on Dresden and it’s tragedy. We follow Billy Pilgrim who as he describes it, has come <em>unstuck in time</em> which causes him to jump between his past, present and future self. Also he gets captured by aliens.</p>
<p>John Green in his Crash Course Literature Videos <a href="#fn1">1</a> <a href="#fn2">2</a> talks at length about the book, and it’s through these that I was able to better understand the book.</p>
<p>To be honest, I don’t really have a lot of thoughts about the book. I read the work casually and did not give it the attention it required of me.</p>
<p>I will read this book again, once I have seen more of life, read more books and lived a little, maybe then I’ll come to appreciate all the subtleties and nuances of Vonnegut’s work.</p>
