    <main><p>Been a while since the last one, but I've been relatively useful. Following on from the previous dev log some updates.</p>
<p>I'm gonna be done with my practical exams today. They were'nt a huge problem but moreso a chore that needed doing. There's going to be other exams, but they aren't going to be a huge hurdle hopefully.</p>
<p>I managed to get an interview for an internship with a couple of companies. I completely butchered my first one, but I've been assigned a task, which needs to be done by the 7th. When I say butchered I really do mean butchered, I forgot what position I was applying for, forgot to mention what I'd made, what I was good/bad at, why I'd be a good fit, yeah, not my finest hour. The other interview was postponed to the 8th which is kinda perfect, since I get the time to focus on my task. It's an <a href="https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/index.html">ansible</a>, automation task. More information after I've completed it. I've been documenting my failures and progress, both for the eventual code review and a dev log.</p>
<p>I haven't been able to give my time and concentration to MLH because of that, which sucks. I do feel really guilty about it, it's my responsibility and it's my job to make time for it.</p>
<p>I've been doing drawabox on a regular basis and I got back to where I left off the program toady, so everything starting now is gonna be fresh and new which I'm looking forward to. I might make a separate section with all my drawabox work once I'm done with say, Lesson 1.</p>
