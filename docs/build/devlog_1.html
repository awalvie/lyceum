    <main><p>Spent six hours trying to find and fix memory leaks with my Static Site Generator. I was planning switching to the new website today, but there are critical errors that halted progress. The flow of the SSG is very simplistic right now.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>Get contents of the data directory into a C string array</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol start="2">
<li>Read the metadata on top of the file and the rest of the content</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol start="3">
<li>Generate the static HTML files from that content</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I’ve identified that I have a memory leak which leads to a buffer overflow causing reading multiple files to have undefined behavior when I read the contents of the source file into a C Structure meant to store the metadata and the contents.</p>
<p>Assessing today I realize that I might have made more progress if I took breaks while debugging. I was frustrated, drained, exhausted and more importantly left irritable after having sat on the PC for so long. I have tried the pomodoro technique in the past but never stuck to it. I want a simple minimal application that has a timer that shows up on the status bar of my screen, but I haven’t found any. I’ll look for one.</p>
<p>Other than that I had a long meeting with the startup that I am working with. We tried to figure out problems we were having while writing routes for our website.</p>
