    <main><p>The past couple of days work has been slow. Since this is the first time that has happened in the past 3 weeks, I took this opportunity to start learning things that I'll be needing in the coming months.</p>
<p>This is my first time doing devops as I mentioned in the previous log, I'm a beginner in the domain. I asked around on the fediverse for resources/books that I could read to have a better understanding of how to approach the field. A good friend of mine shared <a href="https://sre.google/sre-book/table-of-contents/">Google's book on SRE</a> apparently regarded as the <strong>bible of SRE</strong>, which I'll make a habit of reading a chapter every day. Couple more fediverse suggestions were <a href="https://12factor.net/">The 12 Factor app</a>, and <a href="https://martinfowler.com/">Martin Fowler's Blog</a>. Will remeber to reference these when I'm lost.</p>
<p>Next, I've been told that in the coming months I'll be working on pieces that involve work that lies at the cross-section of backend and ops. I'm a beginner to Golang as well so I was looking for a good way to get a handle of the language when a colleague recommended <a href="https://gophercises.com/">Gophercises</a>. I thankfully did not succumb to my usual, try and find the &quot;Best&quot; way to learn for an entire day, only to never bother doing it and instead have just started it and commiting code to my <a href="https://github.com/awalvie/cookbook">cookbook</a> on GitHub.</p>
