<blockquote>
<p>You can’t stop a soldier from being frightened but you can give him motivation to help him overcome that fear. I have no such motivation. I can’t have. I’m a witcher: an artificially created mutant. I kill monsters for money. I defend children when their parents pay me to. If Nilfgaardian parents pay me, I’ll defend Nilfgaardian children. And even if the world lies in ruin - which does not seem likely to me - I’ll carry on killing monsters in the ruins of this world until some monster kills me. That is my fate, my reason, my life and my attitude to the world. And it is not what I chose. It was chosen for me.</p>
<p>– Geralt</p>

<p>I was trying to get rid of my YouTube addiction when I found <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCw--xPGVVxYzRsWyV1nFqgg">this guy’s</a> channel, his genuine sincerity and love for the genre coupled with the Witcher TV adaptation coming out soon, I decided to start reading the books. This is my first fantasy series and it’s been pretty fun,</p>
<p>I wasn’t really expecting anything, but I had a great time with this book, I was familiar with the characters already since I’d played Witcher 3 which helped greatly while reading, that is also part of the reason why I did not read the fist two books which are just short stories that introduce the cast of characters and how they are related to each other.</p>
<p>The book, is good, all the characters have very distinct personalities and are very likable, you aren’t really given a lot of character development because that is the main focus with the first two books, and you just get going with the plot, the plot has a <strong>Chosen One</strong> (which I’m not really a fan of) but it’s handeled really well. The story unfolds against the backdrop of a world torn by war. The world building felt authentic and gave a lot of justification to the motivations of our characters. The book does slow down, especially when Geralt is not in the picture but all in all I had a great time with the book and would recommend it to others.</p>
