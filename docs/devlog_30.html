    <main><p>I have fixed 3 issues for Kiwi TCMS now. While the issues are simple enough, it's nice to meaningfully be able to contribute to an opensource project, which was one of my original goals with the MLH fellowship. Getting your PR merged is always a nice feeling and I plan on fixing a whole lot more. There's four of us now that are working on Kiwi, the current issues that we're working on are for increasing test coverage for the codebase, but there's been a surge in the number of <strong>feature requests</strong>, which we are planning on getting to. My approach with solving issues is very straightforward for now:</p>
<ol>
<li>Get an issue assigned to me.</li>
<li>Navigate to the function/file that needs tests written.</li>
<li>Use already existing tests as reference to write mine.</li>
<li>Make PR, get it reviewd and merged</li>
</ol>
<p>One of my other goals with MLH was to find and make more friends. I'm happy to say that it's going well. I'm in an environment where everyone I talk to is helpful, fun and gracious with their time. I'm surrounded by people that work-harder and are smarter than me and I'm having a great time learning things.</p>
<p>In more news, I'm planning to take part in the Github Game-Off. I found teammaters on the MLH Discord hastily yesterday. We don't have an idea yet, but we're working on it.</p>
<p>I also have my show and tell on Thursday. I have no idea what I'm gonna do for it, but figuring that out is going to be my primary objective tomorrow.</p>
<p>Lastly, I've started using Trello with the <a href="https://hamberg.no/gtd/">GTD Method</a>, to be more organized with my life and the things that need doing. Previously I tried doing the same using the <a href="https://danlucraft.com/blog/2008/04/plain-text-organizer/">One Big Text File</a> method, but because I was just logging everything I did, the file became more of a dumpster that I just threw things into. The whole point of GTD is to actively work with your tasks and lists, so I'm hoping it will help.</p>
