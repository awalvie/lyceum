<p>Books get a separate section because I love reading and I tend to read a lot. I used to read sproradically when I was
    younger, and stopped altogether during my high school years. Those were not good years. During the second year of my
    University I read the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Immortals_of_Meluha">Meluha</a> series but never
    ended up reading more. It was in December of 2019 that I decided to read up on the Witcher books, simply because the
    TV adaptation was to be released soon. I've kept up the reading habit since.</p>
<p>I follow an <a href="book_outline.html">outline</a> when I am writing down my thoughts for a book so that I can have a structured way of assessing what and how I felt about the book.</p>
<p>To anyone who wants to develop a reading habit I would suggest watching the wonderful video beneath, as I distinctly
    remember being driven to read more after I viewed it</p>
