# Dev Log 25

I woke up to find that we had been alloted our projects and I had gotten
[Click](https://github.com/pallets/click). From Click's README on GitHub,

_"Click is a Python package for creating beautiful command line interfaces in a
composable way with as little code as necessary. It's the "Command Line
Interface Creation Kit". It's highly configurable but comes with sensible
defaults out of the box."_

Which tells me that it's a python version of
[ncurses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ncurses). A lot python projects use
click extensively for interacting with the user, a few of the examples being
Flask and Django. Since it's a relatively small library it doesn't have a
complicated development setup and I was able to get it up and running very
quickly. I'll be resetting my sleep schedule back to the morning time so the
gold for tomorrow is going to be to pick up an issue and then trying to make a
PR for it. I'm excited to work on it and am looking forward to helping out!

**Correction**

I've just been made aware that my comparision of click with ncurses is
unfounded. Click is a CLI UI library whereas ncurses is a for writing TUI
applications. I'm thankful for having friends that correct me when I make
stupid and un-researched conclusions!
