# Dev Log 28

I did not have power today for about 6 hours, most of which I slept. Yesterday
I made two PRs which I'm waiting for reviews on. I kinda just got what I was
supposed to do after I made the first one and made another one for a different
issue without first getting it asssigned to me. Yeah, not a good idea, yes I'm
eager to contribute, but I should also be patient, a lesson to learn.

Since I can't really do much on the project until my PRs are reviewed I started
looking into how to make a RSS feed for my website, specifically my dev logs,
because a friend asked me that I should. Unfortunately, the C code I've writtn
is messy, I'll have to either refactor it a lot, or write bad code. I tried
writing part of it today, but failed miserably.

I also need to start looking for a 4-6 month intership as the next semester
will be my final one and we need to make a major project which is usually made
by working at some organization/company.

There's also my show and tell next week on thursday. A show and tell is where
any one of the pod members gives a talk on something related to technology. I
originally planned on doing one on Plan9, but I haven't really gotten the time
to myself set it up and play around with it yet. I'll either have to look for a
different topic or gather a basic understanding of Plan9 in 10 days, which
seems highly unlikely.
