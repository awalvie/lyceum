# Dev Log 16

Noodle is done, @neauoire wrote most of it, but I was happy to be able to
meaningfully contribute a little to the project. Now I'm going to learng
golang. It has a lot of open-source projects and I think I'm going to have a
fun time learning it. Today I'll go through the [Tour of
Go](https://tour.golang.org/welcome/1).
