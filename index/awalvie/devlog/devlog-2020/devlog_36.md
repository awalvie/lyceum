# Dev Log 36

Been a while since the last one, but I've been relatively useful. Following on
from the previous dev log some updates.

I'm gonna be done with my practical exams today. They were'nt a huge problem
but moreso a chore that needed doing. There's going to be other exams, but they
aren't going to be a huge hurdle hopefully.

I managed to get an interview for an internship with a couple of companies. I
completely butchered my first one, but I've been assigned a task, which needs
to be done by the 7th. When I say butchered I really do mean butchered, I
forgot what position I was applying for, forgot to mention what I'd made, what
I was good/bad at, why I'd be a good fit, yeah, not my finest hour. The other
interview was postponed to the 8th which is kinda perfect, since I get the time
to focus on my task. It's an
[ansible](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/index.html), automation task.
More information after I've completed it. I've been documenting my failures and
progress, both for the eventual code review and a dev log.

I haven't been able to give my time and concentration to MLH because of that,
which sucks. I do feel really guilty about it, it's my responsibility and it's
my job to make time for it.

I've been doing drawabox on a regular basis and I got back to where I left off
the program toady, so everything starting now is gonna be fresh and new which
I'm looking forward to. I might make a separate section with all my drawabox
work once I'm done with say, Lesson 1.
