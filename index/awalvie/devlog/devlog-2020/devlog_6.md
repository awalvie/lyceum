# Dev Log 6

I've been having difficulty with tengi, mostly because of my in-experience with
the language. I found these really well made [re-writing BSD 4.4 Shell
Commands](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcFVlUyZm22BB6-pPqxZSMg/videos) and
I've been studying them, to get an understanding of how to write general C
code. I was very surprised when I saw that you could simple access the source
code of these commands and easily take a look at how they are written. I dont'
have confidence while writing code and usually feel I'm not smart enough, which
causes me second-guess every choice I make, wasting a lot of time in-between. I
was reading [Haikyu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haikyu!!) and a character
said something that hit home.

While I still do fear my incompetence and don't trust in my ability to write
code, it is an opportunity to learn something new and I'll let that motivate me
to get past those fears
