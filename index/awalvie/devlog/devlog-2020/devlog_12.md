# Dev Log 12

In the last log I talked about attempting to repackage the `zathura-pdf-mupdf`
extension for Debian based systems. I opened an issue for the same on the
project's GitLab page but was informed that the issue is already being tracked
and needs someone to fix the `mupdf` package first. So yeah, that was
disappointing. Because I was left with nothing to do, I turned to my trusty
[things to do](https://github.com/awalvie/things-to-do/issues) repository. I
use it to keep track of interesting project ideas to work on. I first thought
about making a bandwidth monitor as a small utility program to learn the basics
of networking with C, but I didn't find a lot of support on the freenode `##C`
and `##programming` IRC channels for the same, so I decided a better idea would
be to write a simple HTTP server in C to learn the basics of it. I'm very proud
of the name, it's called [Simper](https://github.com/awalvie/simper), (get it,
because it's a SIMPle sERver, yeah... I'll go in the corner now).
