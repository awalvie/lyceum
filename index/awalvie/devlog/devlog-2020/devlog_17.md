# Dev Log 17

I've got some time off right now. I got accepted into the Fall batch of the MLH
Fellowship, specifically the open source track. It's a 12 week program starting
from October 5 all the way to December 21. Since I've just received the
enrollment confirmation email and I don't have any information about the
project that I'll be contributing to, except for the fact that it'll be in
python, I've just kinda been doing nothing recently. For the next 4-5 days I'm
just going to be reading and prepping for Inktober, probably play some Breath
of the Wild and work on Uni projects.
