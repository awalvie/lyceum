# Dev Log 34

I write this two days after we've submitted our hackathon project, [MLH
Township](https://github.com/zerefwayne/mlh-township). The original project
idea was to make an RPGesq web game, where you could find people throughtout
the fellowship by walking around on the map, and play mini-games and have
discussion rooms where you could talk about different topics or ongoing MLH
Events.

As it usually is the original idea proved to be far trickier than I had
initally expected, and we barely managed to scrape together by the end of the
hackathon a very simple version of the original idea.

I didn't contribute a whole lot of code to the projcet, both because I was
pretty sick and because I didn't know either of NodeJS or React (which the
project is written in). I did get to know however a lot about websockets and
webRTC and how to use them in an actual project which was great.
