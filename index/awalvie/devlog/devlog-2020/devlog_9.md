# Dev Log 9

I've had relatives over since yesterday (yeah, I protested given the present
situation, but I'm still a **kid**), and by now, they are driving me nuts. I
don't do well (even with relatives) with people for elongated periods of time,
especially when it's pampered, whining, loud, annoying teens (yes, my mental
age is 40, go figure). Also since apparantly I'm the circus clown I'm told to
spend my time with them. Yesterday, I wasn't able to do anything. I needed to
get work done, so I woke up at 3:15 AM today and got things done. I hate wasted
days, and since I've been trying to get better, I did not want to give myself
the opportunity to relapse.

I did start with writing the code for `Stage 1` of the shell workshop. It's
been pretty fun. I noticed some issues with my NeoVim config and also debugged
those. `AutoClose` does not work well in conjunction with `Coc`. I had to press
`Esc` twice to get rid of it's autocomplete suggestions which had been bugging
me for a while. I also found a neat little trick to show my indent lines while
editing code. Finally I've been writing code according to the kernel style
guide and it seemed wonky at first but after 4 hours of reading and writing
code, I can definitely see why it's the standard.

Finally, Devine's probably going to be here in a couple of days and I'm so
excited!
