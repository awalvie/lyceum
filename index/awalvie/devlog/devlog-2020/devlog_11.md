# Dev Log 11

Good day today, I went out to the gym early in the morning and have been
feeling good since then. I've not been productive, again, since the last log,
so I was looking for opensource projects to contribute to for a small while,
before I start working under Devine. I was scouring GitHub, looking for
interesting projects to contribute to. The original goal was to identify
opensource applications that I use on a regular basis and contribute to those,
but that did not work out very well. Some of the projects like `TMUX` or
`Taskwarrior` were too stable and did not see too much activity. On the other
had you have projects like `VIM` and `Git` that have a very steep learning
curve. I did find a couple of projects that satisfied all the things I was
looking for, those being `Neomutt` and `Weechat`, did not pick them to
contribute to though. There is a plugin for `Zathura` that is currently only
packaged for arch-based distros and not for debian called `zathura-pdf-mupdf`.
It's used for reading EPUB files. That is what I decided on and am going to
work on for the next while. The rest of the day then was spent in properly
setting up `Weechat`, configuring it and contacting the project owner to ask if
this was something they would be interested in and some pointers to get
started.
