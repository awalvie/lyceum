# Dev Log 56

### Work

It's been two weeks since I joined Deepsource as a Site Reliability Engineer.
I've been getting familiar with the infrastructure and it's components. It was
a lot to take in initially, but both by spending time understanding and talking
to folks in the team, I've started feeling more comfortable in my ability to
maneuver my way around it. I've also been tinkering with
[MiniKube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/) as suggested by a collegue
to get acquainted with K8s. Apart from tech, less meetings weekly, daily
check-ins to keep track progress and that's about it, there's no
micromanagement. Overall I'm happy and looking forward to contributing to the
team!

### Personal

**Refactor dotfiles** I've been tinkering with my
[dotfiles](https://github.com/awalvie/dotfiles) ever since I got my work
laptop. Improving the file structure, splitting `.zshrc` and `.vimrc` into
separate files and more.

**Neovim 5.0** I was informed that `Neovim v0.5` is out and now supports a
built-in LSP that can be configured in `Lua`. So I'll be trying it out and
seeing how it fares against `coc.vim`.

**Rewrite Lyceum in Golang** This has been a long standing task, so I'll have
to block some time out to iteratively get this going.

Other than that, I've been doing good! Planning tasks in my notebook to-do
list, have been sleeping and waking early, reading regularly. Off the bandwagon
of hobby habits, plan to rectify that in the near future.
