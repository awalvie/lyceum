# Dev Log 41

I love Studio Ghibli. The fantastic worlds of Hayao Miyazaki always stir
emotions that I'm not articulate enough to describe. I was pleasantly surprised
when I was recently made aware that the Studio has been releasing still images
from across it's filmography throughout 2020 for free use. [Go have a
look](https://www.ghibli.jp/info/013409/).

The site is a tad difficult to navigate and I love having things like these
offline, so I spent the morning writing a
[webscraper](https://github.com/awalvie/cookbook/tree/master/python/projects/ghibli).
I also made a torrent out of the images to share with anyone interested, you
can [download it
here](https://github.com/awalvie/lyceum/raw/master/docs/static/files/ghibli_images.torrent).
