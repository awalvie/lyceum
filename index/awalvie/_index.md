## Awalvie

Vishesh or awalvie as he likes to call himself on the internet currently
works as a Site Reliability Engineer at
[DeepSource](https://deepsource.io/). His weekends start with a nice

```sh
mkdir super_awesome_project
```

and end with a keyboard banging

```sh
rm -rf ./super_awesome_project
```

He developed a fatal attraction to coffee, [books](books.html)
[writing](writing.html) and [art](art.html) over his adult life and is
greatly fond of running and aspires to hike and explore nature.

## Site

This site is inspired by Devine Lu Linvega's
[XXIIVV](https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/home.html) and shares the same
purpose to collate and interconnect information so that it may be
consulted with exceeding speed and flexibility.

The site is built using
[go-blender](https://github.com/awalvie/go-blender) a lightweight static
site generator written in Go. The wiki is hosted via Github Pages.

There are no analytics on the wiki. I don't like being tracked and I don't
think you do either. All content hosted on this site is available under
the **Creative Commons BY-NC-SA** license. All source for this site is
available under **MIT** [on GitHub](https://github.com/awalvie/lyceum).
