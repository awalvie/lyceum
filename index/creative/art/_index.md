I'd heard about Van Gogh of course, I'd seen [The Starry
Night](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Starry_Night), looked up the
absurd amount of money that one of his pieces was worth.  My teenage
brain had formed a bias against him and painters in general, it was fun
to bash modern art for it's apparent simplicity as teenagers. Only later
in my 20s when I learnt about his life did I gain an appreciation and
love for the arts that I haven't lost and try to emulate myself.
Exemplifying the beauty of the world around us is as noble and virtuous
a purpose in life as can be.
