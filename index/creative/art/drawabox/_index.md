[Drawabox](https://drawabox.com/) is a set of free exercise-based
lessons that focus on the fundamentals - the skills you'll need to make
sense of all the other resources and tutorials out there. First we focus
on the basic mechanics of mark making, and how to use your arm. By the
end, we develop a strong understanding of form, 3D space and
construction.
