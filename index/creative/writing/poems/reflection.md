# Reflection

<pre class="poem">
"I roam intoxicated,
sane but interested in the moment

Noises, music, drown the melancholy of my mind
I ruminate on my past, the future

Search,
for hints of my calling, that lie hidden inside

Hoping they reveal themselves before I lose time
Regret the loss of youth and vigor.

The music returns, the noise bellows
I return back to life forgetting
the one I need to live"
</pre>
