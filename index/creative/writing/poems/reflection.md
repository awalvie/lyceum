# Reflection

<pre class="poem">
"I roam, intoxicated,
sane, interested, in the moment

Noises, music, drown the melancholy of my mind
I ruminate on the past, the future

Search,
for hints, of my calling, that lie hidden within

Hoping for revelations, before I lose time

The music returns, the noise bellows
I return back to life,
forgetting the one I need to live"
</pre>
