I'm bad at arguing. I miss the point, go on tangents, cannot present my
arguments coherently or critique ones presented to me and end up making
a fool of myself. To get better at logic and critical thinking I
actively look for resources and books. While looking through book
recommendations on reddit I found a comment that explained the mechanics
of arguments in a straightforward and concise manner. It struck a cord
and made sense in a way that other resources until this point had not.
I'll be trying to teach what the post taught on my own to better retain
the information and also identify any holes in my understanding.

An argument is made up of three components.

1. Premise
2. Inference
3. Conclusion

### **Valid vs Sound Argument**

An argument is **valid** if the conclusion follows from the premises.

> Premise: All humans have tails
>
> Premise: Michael Jordan is human
>
> Conclusion: Michael Jordan has a tail

The conclusion follows the premises hence the argument is valid, but the
premise is false hence the argument isn't sound

An argument is **sound** if all it's premises are true and the conclusion
necessarily follows from the premises.

> Premise: All stars emit light
>
> Premise: The Sun is a star
>
> Conclusion: The Sun emits light

All premises are true and the conclusion necessarily follows from the
premises.


### Critiquing Arguments

- When presented with an argument, identify and categorize it into
Premise, Inference, Conclusion.
- Use deduction, experience, common
knowledge and intelligence to challenge any of the three facets of the
argument.
- Repeat the process recursively until you get a clear,
unambiguous, valid argument, with which you can engage.

Taking an example:

> Friend: Eminem is the best rapper of all time.

This is an argument. The premises are concealed. So you ask, "Why?"

> He says: Because his music affected a generation in a way no one has
> ever done before.

The argument now is:

> P1: Eminem's music affected a generation in a way no one has ever done
> before.
>
> Therefore C: Eminem is the best rapper of all time.

This argument is invalid. The conclusion doesn't necessarily follow from
the premise. To make the argument valid, one needs to insert the
following:

> P1: If a rapper's music affects a generation in a way no one has ever
> done before, then said rapper is the best of all time.
>
> P2: Eminem is a rapper.
>
> P3: Eminem affected a generation in a way no one has ever done before.
>
> Therefore, C: Eminem is the best rapper of all time.

Now, this argument isn't sound. P1 isn't obviously true; "bestness" in
the context of rapping can't necessarily be reduced to the ambiguous
phrase, "affecting a generation in a way no one has ever done before".
So, as your friend's interlocutor, you would ask:

> What does it mean to affect a generation in a way no one has ever done
> before? And why does bestness follow from this?
