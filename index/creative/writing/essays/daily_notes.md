# Daily Notes

Learning things usually involves significant effort. Grappling with the
unknown is difficult and time-consuming. Notes (in theory), allow us to
maintain a corpus of knowledge about information we have encountered,
that can be referred to instead of the source material to refresh our
understanding of the subject matter. This noble idea usually falls flat
in practise if note-taking is done passively, just for the sake of doing
it. Passive note-taking gives the illusion of ensuring that a piece of
information won’t be forgotten, since we’ve written it down. Yes, it
won’t be forgotten, it will be lost instead, in the pile of notes that
get created this way. They won’t accumulate any insight. In reality
creating an external brain of sorts, consisting of information accrued
in interconnected notes takes significant time, effort and care itself.
Take [Andy
Matuschak’s](https://publish.obsidian.md/andymatuschak/Evergreen+notes)
**evergreen notes** as an exmaple.

The above is traditionally the purpose of note-taking. Instead daily
notes serve the following purposes:

- As scratchpads for temporarily supporting working memory that will be
  written and discarded. They serve as a way to engage with the subject
  material actively and help process it.
- Records of daily work and progress, which can be transformed into
  technical/development blogs on the website.
- Streamline and simplify weekly reflections/reviews, no guess-work or
  forgetting both completed and pending tasks.

Hence they are by design ephemeral. I don't need to spend time
categorizing, tagging or linking them. Note things down if I need to get
a better understanding of the subject-matter, or just to reinforce an
existing concept, then forget about them.
