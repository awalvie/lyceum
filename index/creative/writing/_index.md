# Writings

> A book is made from a tree. It is an assemblage of flat, flexible parts
> (still called "leaves") imprinted with dark pigmented squiggles.
> One glance at it and you hear the voice of another person, perhaps
> someone dead for thousands of years. Across the millennia, the author is
> speaking, clearly and silently, inside your head, directly to you.
> Writing is perhaps the greatest of human inventions, binding together
> people, citizens of distant epochs, who never knew one another. Books
> break the shackles of time, proof that humans can work magic.
>
> â€• Carl Sagan
