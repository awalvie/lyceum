# Outline

I like to summarise my thoughts after having read/dropped a book.
I used to write impromptu, but soon noticed that all entries looked
identical. It is for this reason I used the format and questions below
to stimulate and assess my thoughts and feelings about the book in
question.

### Introductory Paragraph

- Identify the title, the author, and the publisher of the book.
- Summarize the main idea/theme of the book you are reviewing in one or
  two sentences.
- Write your thesis (what you think of the book). Example: I loved the
  book but I had some problems with it. Example: I thought the book has
  useful information for parents of deaf children.

### Body Paragraph(s)

- Summarize the important points of the book (This can be one or several
  paragraphs.) Use quotes or paraphrases from the book to prove your
 points.

### Evaluate (one or several paragraphs)

- Explain the writerâ€™s purpose for writing the book. Give your opinion
  on whether the writer achieved her/his purpose in writing the book.

### Criticize/praise the book

- Explain to your audience if you thought the book was entertaining or
  boring, has good characters or unrealistic characters, has thorough
  information or inadequate information.
- Use quotes or paraphrases from the book to prove your points.

### Conclusion

- Review the main points of your argument.
- Remind the reader of your thesis (whether or not you thought the book
  was good).
