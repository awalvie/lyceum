### Reading

- [The Master and Margarita](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Master_and_Margarita)
- [Spiritual Enlightenment: The Damnedest Thing](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/149961.Spiritual_Enlightenment)

I follow an [outline](book_outline.html) when I write my thoughts on a
book so as to have a structured way of assessing what and how I felt
about the book.

For people looking to develop a reading habit I would suggest watching
the wonderful video beneath, as I distinctly remember being driven to
read after.
