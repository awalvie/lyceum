### Reading

- [Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surely_You're_Joking%2C_Mr._Feynman!)
- [The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wind-Up_Bird_Chronicle)

I follow an [outline](book_outline.html) when I write my thoughts on a
book so as to have a structured way of assessing what and how I felt
about the book.

For people looking to develop a reading habit I would suggest watching
the wonderful video beneath, as I distinctly remember being driven to
read after.

**TODO**: Create a bookshelf page that uses [Library of Congress
Classification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_of_Congress_Classification)
for all read books.
