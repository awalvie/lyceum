### Reading: [Brave New World](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brave_New_World)

I used to read sproradically when I was younger, and stopped altogether
during my high school years. Those were not good years.  During my
sophormore year I read the
[Meluha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Immortals_of_Meluha) series
but never ended up reading more. It was in December of 2019 that I
decided to read up on the Witcher books, simply because the TV
adaptation was being release. I've kept up the reading habit
since.

I follow an [outline](book_outline.html) when I am writing down my
thoughts for a book so that I can have a structured way of assessing
what and how I felt about the book.

To anyone who wants to develop a reading habit I would suggest watching
the wonderful video beneath, as I distinctly remember being driven to
read more after I viewed it
