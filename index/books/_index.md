### Reading: [Brave New World](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brave_New_World)

> “Until I feared I would lose it, I never loved to read. One does not

>
> – Harper Lee, To Kill a Mockingbird

I follow an [outline](book_outline.html) when I am writing down my

what and how I felt about the book.

For people looking to develop a reading habit I would suggest watching

read after.
