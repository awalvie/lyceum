### Reading

#### Considering

- [The Power of Now - Eckhart Tolle](https://www.librarything.com/work/11451)
- Bhagvad Gita (Given I can find a good translation)
    - Eknath Easwaran
    - Georg Feuerstein
- [Animal Liberation - Peter Singer](https://www.librarything.com/work/88544)
- [A Swim in a Pond in the Rain - George Saunders](https://www.librarything.com/work/25271707)
- [The Denial of Death - Ernest Becker](https://www.librarything.com/work/73787)
- [Tender Is The Flesh - Agustina Bazterrica](https://www.librarything.com/work/22138551)

### Listening

- [Oathbringer - Brandon Sanderson](https://www.graphicaudiointernational.net/the-stormlight-archive-3-download-series-set.html)

I follow an [outline](book_outline.html) when I write my thoughts on a
book so as to have a structured way of assessing what and how I felt
about the book.

For people looking to develop a reading habit I would suggest watching
the wonderful video beneath, as I distinctly remember being driven to
read after.
