Not a whole lot to say about these books without spoiling them, but another
great entry.

I guess that would be incorrect or better put, dishonest, as much as I am
engrossed in the books while reading them, I don’t really recall a whole lot of
things that really stuck in my mind after reading this, though the adventures
are fantastic the myths, legendary and the fights brutal and savage the plot as
much as I like it remains very predictable, maybe it’s because I’ve played the
3rd Game that I know what’s coming but it all feels very linear and tiring. I
did very much like Ciri’s arc throughout the book, realizing and accepting who
she is and ultimately redeeming herself. The journey of Geralt and his company
was frankly underwhelming, it just existed for the sake of having Geralt go and
kill some people in my opinion. In all fairness, a decent book for the saga,
not too good, not too bad, or as master Dunkey would say,
