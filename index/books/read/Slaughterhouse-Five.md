Kurt Vonnegut’s Slaughterhouse 5 also known by it’s underappreciated alternate
name _The Children’s Crusade_ is an anti-war book. It was written in 1969
during the Vietnam War but it talks about the World War II, the air-raid on
Dresden and it’s tragedy. We follow Billy Pilgrim who as he describes it, has
come _unstuck in time_ which causes him to jump between his past, present and
future self. Also he gets captured by aliens.

John Green in his Crash Course Literature Videos [1](#fn1) [2](#fn2) talks at
length about the book, and it’s through these that I was able to better
understand the book.

To be honest, I don’t really have a lot of thoughts about the book. I read the
work casually and did not give it the attention it required of me.

I will read this book again, once I have seen more of life, read more books and
lived a little, maybe then I’ll come to appreciate all the subtleties and
nuances of Vonnegut’s work.
