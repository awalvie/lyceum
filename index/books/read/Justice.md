Justice: What’s the Right Thing to Do? by Michael Sandel is a fantastic
introduction to the major ideas of Political Philosophy related to Justice. The
book is based on his Harvard course by the same name1. Sandel walks us through
three major ways of thinking about Justice - Utilitarianism (maximizing welfare
for the many), Libertarianism (respecting the freedom of others), and
Aristotle’s Telos (promoting virtue). He introduces these concepts citing
examples from the real world that are easy to digest and understand. I enjoyed
reading the book.

My first philosophical source text was Problems of Philosophy by Bertrand
Russell, while the book is highly recommended for beginners, it was an
extremely difficult read, enough to put me off of reading philosophy
completely. I had to reread passages multiple times for them to make sense to
me. This book on the other hand is very approachable for beginners. The course
and consecutively the book is designed for people who want a taste of
philosophy especially political philosophy. Sandel walks us through three major
ideas and explains their various facets by giving detailed modern examples. How
each discipline would think and the kind of opinions an asserter of that theory
would have. The way each of them thinks about morality, justice, and the nature
of good. Sandel is very objective about the theories (except the last couple of
chapters, where he tells us about his principles and values and with whom they
align with), it almost feels like he’s a narrator in a documentary.

If you are someone who is looking to read about Political Philosophy, this
would be my humble recommendation as a good starting point.
