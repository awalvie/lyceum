Darkenss Visible by William Styron is a memoir of the author’s corporeal
and mental experiences when he was afflicted with crippling, even
suicidal depression. As someone who always thought he suffered from a
mild form of depression I was intrigued when I came across the book and
by the end, left stupefied.

Depression is a taboo topic to discuss in modern society. Styron hints
at how naming the illness **Depression**, a sunken surface, or to lower
in magnitude has caused irreparable damage in it’s understanding. He
proposes that a better word might be a mindstorm, akeen to the chaos of
tempest in the mind. The books is often described as a book that put
depression on the map. The reason for this as Styron points out is that
for a health human mind the situation is incomprehesible.

> their physicians) some of the actual dimensions of their torment, and
> perhaps elicit a comprehension that has been generally lacking; such
> incomprehension has usually been due not to a failure of sympathy but
> to the basic inability of healthy people to imagine a form of torment
> so alien to everyday experience.

To others, Styron’s suffering and infinite pain may never be understood
truly, but his incredible achievement lies in being able to pen down his
descent into the depths of darkness, faithfully and honestly. It will
help people understand and empathize with anyone suffering around them.

Styron states that he was deeply influenced by Albert Camus, especially
his books, The Stranger and the Myth of Sisyphus
