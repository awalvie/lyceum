Hobbes: A Very Short Introduction by Richard Tuck belongs to a catalog
of books published by the Oxford University Press. As the name implies
these books are a short introduction to ideas, individuals among many
other things.

Thomas Hobbes was a 17th century English philosopher who is chiefly
remembered for **Leviathan** which is the definitive and judicious
argument for why the people should obey government authority even of a
very imperfect and brutal kind. He wrote extensively about politics,
human nature, science and had a prolific impact on modern philosophy.
This book is divided into 3 sections which talk about his life, his work
and it’s subsequent interpretation by his peers and the future
generations.

This was my first book related to Philosophy, specifically Political
Philosophy, a branch that I never knew existed. I went into it
half-expecting to be bored because of my apprehension about anything
related to politics. I was mesmerized. I would recommend that if you
solely want to read about Hobbes and his work, you should consider
skipping the first chapter as it’s mostly a biography of his life.

I was at a loss for words when the teacher (who recommended the book to
me) asked me what I thought about the book. It was a very new and
foreign experience for me. A very important lesson I’ve learned is the
importance of reading slowly. You’re not supposed to rush to the end.
People like Hobbes were some of the greatest thinkers in history. They
condensed their infinite wisdom into a 400 page volume of paper. Every
word, every sentence is exactly where it’s supposed to be. The least you
could do is concentrate and pay attention to understand their
propositions and arguments to problems that have plagued humanity from
time immemorial.
