The book meandered a little too much for my taste. Lot’s of fantastic character development, but personally I didn’t really find myself esctatic after finishing the book. I’ve concluded that fantasy is definitely not the genre for me. The only fantasy series that I see myself picking up in the future would be the **First Law** series because it’s part fantasy part grim dark.
