As someone who has lived in cities, I don’t think I will ever truly be
able to appreciate the colossal achievement of the crew of Endurance, or
for that matter, I don’t think a majority of us would. The luxuries and
conveniences of my daily life were really put into perspective while I
was reading this harrowing tale for survival.

The book tells the story of one of the first Trans-Atlantic Expedition
(an expedition to cross the Antarctic) undertaken by the crew of
Endurance under the helm of Sir Ernest Shackelton in 1914 as a measure
of doing something spectacular both for the British Empire and
Shackelton. On December 5, the team departed the island, the last time
Shackleton and his men would touch land for an astonishing 497 days. The
Steam Boat christened **Endurance** became stuck in an ice floe and
forced the crew to bail.

> Thus their plight was naked and terrifying in its simplicity. If they
> were to get out–they had to get themselves out.

The book then follows their struggle to survive in one of the harshest
and most inhospitable environments on the planet.

**Try, try and try again until you succeed**

Quotes like these were smart when I was little, life mottos when I was
younger and then sentences to later cringe at in my adult life. Quotes
and ideas similar to these have been told generation after generation
through thousands of years and have been reduced to their gist and
nothing about them is superfluous anymore, but they are lost in their
effect on people because they have no reason to believe or trust in them
and it’s books and stories like these that reinforce why we ought to.
It’s a tale of human resilience, camaraderie, survival and hope, in the
bleakest of situations.

This is absolutely one of the best books I’ve ever read.
