The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald as author Stephen Fry puts it
**is perfect word for word just in terms of English**. It’s regarded as
one of the greatest American books ever written. Fitzgerald’s
masterpiece chronicles the story of Jay Gatsby told through the lens of
Nick Carraway, highlighting the dysfunctional life of the American
moneyed, scrambling for a time long gone, leaving chaos and destruction
in their wake and ending in (as John Green says) **one of the saddest
chapters in English Literature**.

I read the book after the Fry comment. I had seen the movie, so I knew
the plot but I was interested specifically in the writing. I wanted to
test my ability to understand the subtle nuance that great authors use
and appreciate the book as many critics have. The Crash Course
Videos[^1] about the book helped flesh out my understanding of the book.

The aristocracy feasts while the poor die. Nick puts it very aptly.

It’s a somber book.

A key theme of the book is Gatsby’s desperation to go back to a time
long past. His hope that if only he could have Daisy he could set things
right. The green light being the enchanted object that symbolized Daisy,
money and the American Dream. He believed that the ends would eventually
justify whatever means and would absolve him of his sins. Daisy loving
him was not enough, he wanted her to have never loved Tom. His
insecurity was always hidden under that caviar way of talking. Gatsby is
a very empathetic character and Fitzgerald summarizes why perfectly in
the final line of the book.

> So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into
> the past.

I did not really appreciate the book until I saw the Crash Course
videos. I am partly to blame for it. I was rushing through the book.
Just reading and not really understanding or thinking, but I am happy
that I was able to figure out the problem. Quality over Quantity. The
current book I’m reading (Norwegian Woods), I’m taking all the time in
the world to read. It’s not a stupid challenge[^2] that’s important.
Yes, it’s good motivation but it’s the books and the feelings and
experiences that they provide which are of paramount importance. So in
that light, I’ll be re-reading the book, a slow and methodical read,
taking my time.
