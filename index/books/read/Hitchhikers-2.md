The second book in the Hitchhiker’s Series is as absurd and as funny as
it’s predecessor. It’s the kind of book that you read after coming back
from a hard day of work for some much needed laughter. Escape to the
exploits of 2 humans, a seasoned Betelgeuse Hitchhiker, a depressed
robot and the ex-President of the Universe as they desperately try to
find food and the man who rules the Universe. I loved every single line
of this book.

This legendary sci-fi series combines end of time, time manipulation,
human evolution and madness influenced by one’s unimportance on a cosmic
scale in a short amount of pages that is incredibly fun to read. What
more could you possibly want from a cosmic road-trip.

Dissecting the books satire is highly subjective endeavour. Adams
touches on various themes and the absurdity of our beliefs. The
characters, as enjoyable as their personalities might be are not
genius’s but are rather abnormally normal (except having an extra limb
and a second head). They question reality and accepted beliefs and
demonstrate their fragility frequently.

I got out of this book exactly what I was looking for, a fun, carefree
read, filled with laughter and joy. My only regret is that I didn’t have
a Pan Galactic Gargle Blaster while I was reading it.
