I was trying to get rid of my YouTube addiction when I found [this
guy’s](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCw--xPGVVxYzRsWyV1nFqgg) channel, his
genuine sincerity and love for the genre coupled with the Witcher TV adaptation
coming out soon, I decided to start reading the books. This is my first fantasy
series and it’s been pretty fun,

I wasn’t really expecting anything, but I had a great time with this book, I
was familiar with the characters already since I’d played Witcher 3 which
helped greatly while reading, that is also part of the reason why I did not
read the fist two books which are just short stories that introduce the cast of
characters and how they are related to each other.

The book, is good, all the characters have very distinct personalities and are
very likable, you aren’t really given a lot of character development because
that is the main focus with the first two books, and you just get going with
the plot, the plot has a **Chosen One** (which I’m not really a fan of) but
it’s handeled really well. The story unfolds against the backdrop of a world
torn by war. The world building felt authentic and gave a lot of justification
to the motivations of our characters. The book does slow down, especially when
Geralt is not in the picture but all in all I had a great time with the book
and would recommend it to others.
