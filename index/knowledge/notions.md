Collected notes and articles from around the internet

### Sociology

**Campbells Law:** The more any quantitative social indicator is used
for social decision-making, the more subject it will be to corruption
pressures and the more apt it will be to distort and corrupt the social
processes it is intended to monitor.

**Parkinson's Law:** Work expands so as to fill the time available for
its completion.
