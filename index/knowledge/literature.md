# Literature

A collection of literary works that left an impresssion.

## Poetry

> When laughter and tears desert these walls,  
> When emptiness fills our hearts,  
> And memories turn to scars,  
> Our tomorrows will lose their light.  
> When time  
> flows against its current,  
> Poetry lifts its veil.  
> If our pulses fall out of rhythm,  
> Our love will guard the measure.  
> 
> Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 | Behind the Music
