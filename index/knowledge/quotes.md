*There is no such thing as talent. There is only a history of one's self
that is so easily forgotten. A history full of experiences - or a
history devoid of them. A history of exposure to some things over
others. So relax. You're not special. You're not uniquely ungifted.
You're just showing up to a jousting match armed with a bow and arrow,
and don't yet fully understand the difference. But you will, if you're
willing to get knocked down to the ground over and over again. You're
allowed to feel down on yourself, and you're allowed to cry over your
scrapes. Just don't forget: rather than talent, it is another t-word
that makes a master. Tenacity.*

those around you; the energy of one, the modesty of another, the
generosity of a third. For there is nothing more heartening than the
images of the virtues shining forth in the characters of those around
us.*

- **Marcus Aurelius**

*The truth may be puzzling. It may take some work to grapple with. It may
be counterintuitive. It may contradict deeply held prejudices. It may
not be consonant with what we desperately want to be true. But our
preferences do not determine whats true.*

- **Carl Sagan**

*Life should not be a journey to the grave with the intention of arriving
safely in a pretty and well preserved body, but rather to skid in
broadside in a cloud of smoke, thoroughly used up, totally worn out, and
loudly proclaiming "Wow! What a Ride!*

- **Hunter S. Thompson**

*And those who were seen dancing were thought to be insane by those who
could not hear the music*

- **Friedrich Nietzsche**

*Though the wide universe is full of good, no kernel of nourishing corn
can come to him but through his toil bestowed on the plot of ground that
is given to him to till.*

firmament of bards and sages*
