First day of the internship
20200104

<p>Today was my first day as a devops/backend intern at SendX, and it was surprisingly hectic. There was the official onboarding, architecture overview, the devops philosophy of SendX the coding workflow, ideologies and values to be kept in mind while making decisions, an introduction with the whole team and then a brainstorming sessions about what tasks the team is going to be picking for the next 90ish days. Yeah, a pretty long day, but very informative and detailed one. In a different, larger company this would probably have been my first week, but the fact that I'm being inducted into the team at this pace makes me excited for the work that's about to come.</p>
