installing things
linux be weird
20201104

<p>I was trying to install the Godot Engine for developing a game. I went to their <a href="https://godotengine.org/download/linux">website</a>, downloaded and extracted it and it gave me a single file executable. I ran it and it worked, so why the post?</p>
<p>Well, if you've been on linux for long you'll know that usually you install things from the terminal (with a package manager often) and then run them, you don't have to deal with manually placing binaries or executables in the right place. So I thought it would be a good opportunity to share how I learnt to do it. In the case of Godot, these were the steps I followed:</p>

<p>Download Godot, unzip it using:</p>
<pre><code>unzip Godot*.zip</code></pre>

<p>Move the executable to <code>/opt</code>:</p>
<pre><code>sudo mkdir /opt/Godot/
sudo mv Godot_*.64 /opt/Godot/Godot</code></pre>

<p>Make it executable:</p>
<pre><code>sudo chmod +x /opt/Godot/Godot</code></pre>

<p>Now we create a launcher for the Godot executable:</p>
<pre><code>cd ~/.local/share/applications/
vim godot.desktop</code></pre>

<p>Populate the <code>.desktop</code> file, writing this in nano, saving with <code>CTRL-O</code> and exiting with <code>CTRL-X</code>:</p>
<pre><code>[Desktop Entry]
Name=Godot Engine

GenericName=Libre game engine
Comment=Multi-platform 2D and 3D game engine with a feature rich editor
Exec=/opt/Godot/Godot -pm
Icon=godot
Terminal=false
Type=Application
Categories=Development;IDE;</code></pre>

<p>and voila, you have *installed* Godot, this should be applicable for most other installs as well.</p>
