got me an internship
20201208

<p>"Warm greetings to my connections! I am happy to share that...", yeah, none of that award acceptance speech that everyone gives on Linkedin, hell na. I did my task well and got accepted for an internship. It was quick because, I got lucky, that's it.</p>

<p>My task is on github, it's called <a href="https://github.com/awalvie/anzibl">anzibl</a>. It was a very interesting task, I had to:</p>
<ul class="single">
	<li>1 Create a small EC2 or DO instance.</li>
	<li>2 Run a small HTTP server (preferably in Golang) with a ping endpoint</li>
	<li>3 Run prometheus on the same machine to monitor ping endpoint and raise an alert over email when either:
		<ul class="single">
			<li>- HTTP server process has crashed</li>
			<li>- Ping endpoint is not responding</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>All of it, infrastructure creation, provisioning (installing relevant software), deployment and monitoring, needed to be automated using <a href="https://www.ansible.com/">ansible</a>. It was a fantastic opportunity to get to learn ansible, prometheus and get familiar with AWS, a little nerve wracking, but fun nonetheless. I got to learn a crap tonne. I wrote down all the steps that I took to get the task completed in a file called <a href="https://github.com/awalvie/anzibl/blob/master/STEPS_TAKEN.md">steps_taken.md</a>.</p>

<p>The internship starts sometime in the first couple of weeks of January, because I have my final uni exams throughout december, which means I have a couple of weeks to spare. I'm planning on starting <a href="https://adventofcode.com/">adventofcode</a>, since all of my merveilles feed is full of people doing it. I'll be attempting it in go, because I enjoy writing go and want to get better at writing it. I'll also be researching more about how <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitTorrent">bittorrent</a> works because I want to write my own client in go. That's about it.</p>
