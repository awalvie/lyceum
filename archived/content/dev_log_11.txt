opensource things
20200818

<p>Good day today, I went out to the gym early in the morning and have been feeling good since then. I've not been productive, again, since the last log, so I was looking for opensource projects to contribute to for a small while, before I start working under Devine. I was scouring GitHub, looking for interesting projects to contribute to. The original goal was to identify opensource applications that I use on a regular basis and contribute to those, but that did not work out very well. Some of the projects like <code>TMUX</code> or <code>Taskwarrior</code> were too stable and did not see too much activity. On the other had you have projects like <code>VIM</code> and <code>Git</code> that have a very steep learning curve.<p>
<p>I did find a couple of projects that satisfied all the things I was looking for, those being <code>Neomutt</code> and <code>Weechat</code>, did not pick them to contribute to though. There is a plugin for <code>Zathura</code> that is currently only packaged for arch-based distros and not for debian called <code>zathura-pdf-mupdf</code>. It's used for reading EPUB files. That is what I decided on and am going to work on for the next while. The rest of the day then was spent in properly setting up <code>Weechat</code>, configuring it and contacting the project owner to ask if this was something they would be interested in and some pointers to get started.</p>
