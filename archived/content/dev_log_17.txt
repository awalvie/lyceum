taking some time off
20200929

<p>I've got some time off right now. I got accepted into the Fall batch of the MLH Fellowship, specifically the open source track. It's a 12 week program starting from October 5 all the way to December 21. Since I've just received the enrollment confirmation email and I don't have any information about the project that I'll be contributing to, except for the fact that it'll be in python, I've just kinda been doing nothing recently. For the next 4-5 days I'm just going to be reading and prepping for Inktober, probably play some Breath of the Wild and work on Uni projects.</p>
