The Well of Ascension (Mistborn #2)
You overthrew him, now you get to rule... or do you?

<p>The book meandered a little too much for my taste. Lot’s of fantastic character development, but personally I didn’t really find myself esctatic after finishing the book. I’ve concluded that fantasy is definitely not the genre for me. The only fantasy series that I see myself picking up in the future would be the <strong>First Law</strong> series because it’s part fantasy part grim dark.</p>
