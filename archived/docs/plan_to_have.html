<p>I don't like buying things unless I'm getting rid of something at the same time, or unless it's essential. The less things I have the more I can concentrate on using and being creative with them. Intent and the drive to act, is more important than possessing the best tools. It's the artist who makes art, not the brush. Here are some of the things I feel would help me in future endeavors.</p>


<ul class='single'>
<li><b>Trekking Gear</b>: Shoes, Bag, Trekking Pole, Trekking Clothing etc.</li>
<p>As mentioned above I have been inspired to trek and experience nature solely due to <a href='https://www.youtube.com/user/KadamsMedia'>Kraig Adam's YouTube Channel</a>. I've always lived my life indoors and never have experienced the nature for what it truly is. I plan on doing so in the future.</p>

<li><b>Chef's Knife</b></li>
<p>I've been learning cooking from my mother during the lockdown. In the tree of skills needed to be self-reliant, cooking is an essential. While I have learnt a lot, my mother has just got used to using dull tools. I've been practicing with an old Chef's Knife, but its not sharp and has a bad handle. Dull knives are more dangerous than sharp knives.</p>

<li><b>Aeropress</b></li>
<p>I have been drinking instant coffee for the past 5-7 years. It doesn't taste good, but it's cheap. I'd like to venture furthur and experiment with brewing methods now that I can afford to invest time and money into the hobby. The brewing apparatus is portable, durable, quick and supposedly produces delicious coffee.</p>
