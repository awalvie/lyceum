<blockquote>
<p>All animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others.</p>
<p>George Orwell, Animal Farm</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Before reading this book I highly recommend that you read <a href="https://www.orwellfoundation.com/the-orwell-foundation/orwell/essays-and-other-works/the-freedom-of-the-press/">this</a> and <a href="https://www.orwellfoundation.com/the-orwell-foundation/orwell/books-by-orwell/animal-farm/preface-to-the-ukrainian-edition-of-animal-farm-by-george-orwell/">this</a>. This will provide you with the necessary context for what’s being talked about in the book.</p>
<p>Captioned <strong>A fairy story</strong> this book is anything but that, antagonized by the humans the animals of Manor Farm revolt and succeed in breaking their chains of enslavement. They agree to abide by the seven commandments that they create with the highest principle being “All animals are equal” but as the story progresses, we see that after all that might not be the case…</p>
<p>Animal Farm is an allegory meant to talk about the Russian Revolution of the 20th Century, in its simplicity Orwell elegantly talks about how the struggle for revolution can morph into a fight for power and how twisted the original ideals become to suit the needs of the current ruler.</p>
<p>It’s a very short book that you can get through in a day and a timeless classic.</p>
