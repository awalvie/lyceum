<p>When I started working on the backend of the startup I'm a part of right now, everything was already setup. I'd setup flask once, a year or so ago, just following along with a tutorial, but setting up a sensible project structure that was comfortable turned out to be surprisingly difficult.</p>
<p>The way the backend is structured is pretty straightforward:</p>
<ul class="single">
	<li>1. Poetry - Dependency Management</li>
	<li>2. Flask - Backend Framework</li>
	<li>3. PostgreSQL - Relational Database</li>
	<li>4. SQLAlchemy - Object Relational Mapper</li>
	<li>5. Marshmallow - Object Serialization and De-serialization</li>
</ul>
<p>It's pretty standard, nothing new. The project structure is:</p>
<pre><code>$ tree backend

├── app.py
├── backend
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── main.py
│   ├── models.py
│   ├── schemas.py
│   └── utils.py
├── config.py
├── docs
├── poetry.lock
├── pyproject.toml
├── README.md
└── route_testing
</code></pre>

<p>This time I went about setting everything up in a step-by-step manner, instead of the usual gungo-ho style of setting things up by looking at duckduckgo and wondering why it doesn't work.</p>

<ul class="single">
	<li>- Ensure flask works</li>
	<li>- Setup PostgreSQL on my machine</li>
	<li>- Connect PostgreSQL with Flask</li>
	<li>- Write a user model and ensure the table is getting created</li>
	<li>- Write the schema for the model</li>
	<li>- Set up flask-login</li>
	<li>- Write the routes for login and signup</li>
	<li>- Test routes</li>
	<li>- Write a sane README for the backend</li>
	<li>- Write the documentation for the APIs</li>
</ul>

<p>It might seem like a lot of things to do, but all of them are small atomic tasks that I could work on one after the other. Breaking problems down into small digestable chunks helps me keep my anxiety low and also make the project surprisingly easy to make.<p>

<p>Then, I played Breath of the Wild for 3 hours, I needed that Master Sword :|</p>
