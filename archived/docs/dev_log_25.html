<p>I woke up to find that we had been alloted our projects and I had gotten <a href="https://github.com/pallets/click">Click</a>. From Click's README on GitHub,</p>
<p><em>"Click is a Python package for creating beautiful command line interfaces in a composable way with as little code as necessary. It's the "Command Line Interface Creation Kit". It's highly configurable but comes with sensible defaults out of the box."</em></p>
<p>Which tells me that it's a python version of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ncurses">ncurses</a>. A lot python projects use click extensively for interacting with the user, a few of the examples being Flask and Django. Since it's a relatively small library it doesn't have a complicated development setup and I was able to get it up and running very quickly. I'll be resetting my sleep schedule back to the morning time so the gold for tomorrow is going to be to pick up an issue and then trying to make a PR for it. I'm excited to work on it and am looking forward to helping out!</p>
<p><strong>Correction</strong></p>
<p>I've just been made aware that my comparision of click with ncurses is unfounded. Click is a CLI UI library whereas ncurses is a for writing TUI applications. I'm thankful for having friends that correct me when I make stupid and un-researched conclusions!</p>
