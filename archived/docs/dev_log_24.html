<p>There seems to have been delay in assigning us our projects. We were supposed to have gotten the projects by Tuesday, but we haven't yet, which means I have some free time. There are a lot of devops enthusiasts in our pod, and our pod learder is very interested in working with the cloud as well. Since Docker is written in Golang, I thought it'd be a good idea to write my own to learn the language practically and build something interesting. A podmate who's comfortable with go recommended me <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Utf-A4rODH8">this</a> to check out while trying to build a container. I started watching it but quickly figured out that I did not understand the syntax well enough yet to be able to figure out what's going on, so today I'll be going through the <a href="https://tour.golang.org/list">Tour of Go</a> to figure most of the syntax out.</p>
